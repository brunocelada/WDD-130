The objective of my website is to be able to promote my skills and talents in a more 
attractive and visually friendly way.

I will do it with graphics, images, gifs and lists that quickly show my achievements, 
my study plans and the % of my progress, my performance in my career, my work history, etc. 
It is practically having a digital CV, like LinkedIn, but personalized to me.

The audience would be companies and employers who are looking for my talents and experience.
